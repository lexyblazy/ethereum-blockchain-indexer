### A (barebones) Ethereum blockchain indexer

This is still a work in progress. I'm working on this project to learn and understand the Go programming language and blockchain technology in general.

I'm also using [Trezor's Blockbook](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook) codebase as reference point.

[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) can be used to run a node locally

To run this project.

```sh
 chmod +x ./start.sh    # grant permissions to the start script
./start.sh
```
