### A (barebones) Ethereum blockchain indexer

This is still a work in progress. I'm using this project to learn and understand the Go programming language and 
blockchain technology in general.

I'm also using [Trezor's Blockbook](https://github.com/trezor/blockbook) codebase as reference point.

To run this project

```
go run main.go --rpcnodeurl=http://localhost:7545
```
